**🚢 Blockchain-Based Logistics and Shipping Platform**

This project is a decentralized logistics and shipping management system built to enhance supply chain transparency, traceability, and security using blockchain technology. It features smart contracts in Solidity,
a React-based frontend, and a Python + MongoDB backend, all connected through Web3.js.
The system also includes MetaMask integration for secure wallet-based authentication and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for intelligent, AI-powered document interaction.

**🛠️ Tech Stack:**
Solidity – Smart contracts for shipment creation, tracking, and ownership transfer on Ethereum.

Web3.js – Enables seamless interaction between the frontend and smart contracts.

MetaMask – Browser-based wallet for secure login, account management, and transaction signing.

React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript – Frontend technologies to deliver a smooth, responsive user interface.

Python – Backend services to support logic, smart contract interaction, and API routing.

MongoDB – Off-chain NoSQL database for storing shipment metadata and history.

npm – Package manager for dependency handling.

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) – Adds AI capabilities for querying logistics documents or FAQs intelligently.

**✨ Features:**
✅ End-to-end blockchain shipment tracking with tamper-proof records.

✅ MetaMask-based authentication and transaction signing.

✅ Web3.js integration to link the frontend directly with blockchain data.

✅ AI-powered logistics assistant using RAG for dynamic document retrieval and Q&A.

✅ Multi-role dashboard for users like shippers, receivers, and inspectors.

**📦 Use Case:**
Perfect for logistics firms, freight managers, or blockchain enthusiasts building secure, smart, and decentralized shipping systems with AI-enhanced decision-making.
